<p>A little about me huh, well I am turning 29 in 2023. I have been designing with HTML for about 6-8 months now. I have about five 
  years experiance with IT so I know how to work with computers, but this is a whole different type of excursion 
  that I am embarking on, and I am excited. I am currently looking to move
  to France in mid 2024, so any positions I will take in the future will be US remote positions.
