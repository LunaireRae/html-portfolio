<h1>The Best Movies According to Ravyn</h1>

<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie, mostly due to it being one of the first <br/>Studio Ghibli movies that I watched. I love the beautiful images<br/> and the homage to the many yokai of japanese lore.</p>

<h3>Treasure Planet</h3>
<p>A story about space pirates and their search for a planet <br/>that houses a hidden treasure of a famous dead pirate. <br/> Here you will see betrayal, romance, compassion, and redemption.</p>

<h3>Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind</h3>
<p>Another Studio ghibli movie and wow it is a super beautiful<br/> film, with another fascinating tale of people living after the fall of civilization.<br/> Where the world says no more to the pollution and damage that humans have wrought,<br/> with many poisonous plants and massive insects.</p>
